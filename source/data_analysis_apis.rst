Data Analysis APIs
==================

Keenâ€™s data analysis APIs can be broken into four categories.

* Metrics - Answer questions about events that happened over a single period of time.  Example: The number of users that signed up last month.
* Series - Analyze data over a period of time broken into smaller periods of time.  Example: The number of users that signed up each day last week.
* Progressions - Analyze the dropoff rates of users as they progress through a set of steps.  Example: What is the conversion rate of users landing on the site to creating an account to upgrading their account?
* Extractions - Extract all or subsets of your data in its raw form.

The analysis APIs have common themes that apply to all of them.

* filters - used to narrow down your data to the sub-selection based on event properties
* timeframe - used to narrow down your data to a sub-selection based on timestamp
