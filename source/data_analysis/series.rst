Series
======

A Series allows you to analyze trends in :doc:`Metrics<metrics>` over time. It breaks a timeframe into intervals of hours, days, or weeks, and returns Metrics (numbers) for each of those intervals.

Creating a series request is done by simply adding the :doc:`timeframe` and :doc:`interval` query string parameters to a :doc:`Metric<metrics>` request. If you are already using a timeframe with a Metric, you only need to add the :doc:`interval` query string parameter to turn your Metric into a Series. Pretty cool, huh?


Hereâ€™s an example that counts the number of purchases events we have recorded for each day last week.

.. code-block:: none

    http://api.keen.io/3.0/projects/<project_id>/queries/count?api_key=<key>&collection=purchases&interval=daily&timeframe=last_3_days

The output of a Series request is an array of JSON dictionaries which include the value for each interval in the timeframe.  Here is what the output looks like in our example:

.. code-block:: none

    {
        "result":[
            {
                "value": 12,
                "timeframe": {
                    "start": "2012-08-05T00:00:00",
                    "end": "2012-08-06T00:00:00"
                }
            },
            {
                "value": 6585,
                "timeframe":{
                    "start": "2012-08-06T00:00:00",
                    "end": "2012-08-07T00:00:00"
                }
            },
            {
                "value": 3586,
                "timeframe": {
                    "start": "2012-08-07T00:00:00",
                    "end": "2012-08-08T00:00:00"
                }
            },
        ]
    }

As you might have noticed, the series output forms the data set for a basic bar chart or line graph.

Please note that there is a limitation on the number of analyses that can be done in a single Series. The current limit is 31. That means your specified interval and timeframe can't have more than 31 buckets or "sub-timeframes". For example, running a Series with an "hourly" interval over the timeframe "last_5_days" would produce an analysis query with 24 hours x 5 days = 120 sub-timeframes. You will get an error about having too many sub-timeframes. If you run the same query with a "daily" interval and timeframe of "last_5_days" you would have one sub-timeframe per day and a total of 5 sub-timeframes. Easily under the limit.

Here are some example questions you could answer with a Series:

* How many times was content shared in the last 24 hours? When was the most popular time to share?
* How much revenue was generated for each of the past 8 weeks?
* Is the usage of our new feature increasing?
* How many users signed up each day last week?
