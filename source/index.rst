Welcome

Keen IO helps developers understand how people use the applications they create. We provide cloud infrastructure and REST APIs for :doc:`Data Collection <data-collection/index>` and :doc:`Data Analysis <data-analysis/index>`. Use Keen.io to record user interactions, then use our APIs to analyze your data. One more thing - we also support full data extraction so you can get your data into Excel, Hadoop, or any other tools you might need. 

Choose one of these options to get started:

* Our :doc:`getting-started-guide` will walk you through a hands-on cURL example. 
* iOS devs: jump straight into :doc:`integrating your iOS app <clients/iOS/usage-guide>`. Download `our SDK <http://keen.io/static/code/KeenClient.zip>`_.
* Ruby folks: Gem install Keen. Reference :doc:`our Ruby Client Usage Guide <clients/ruby/usage-guide>`.
