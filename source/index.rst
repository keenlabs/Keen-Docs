Welcome

Keen.io helps developers understand how people are using their applications. We provide cloud infrastructure and REST APIs for :doc:`Data Collection <data_collection/data_collection>` and :doc:`Data Analysis <data_analysis/data_analysis>`. Use Keen.io to record user interactions, then use our APIs to analyze your data. One more thing - we also support full data extraction so you can get your data into Excel, Hadoop, or any other tools you might need. 

Choose one of these options to get started:

	* Our :doc:`getting_started_guide` will walk you through a hands-on cURL example. 
	* iOS devs: jump straight into :doc:`integrating your iOS app <clients/iOS/usage_guide>`. Download `our SDK <http://keen.io/static/code/KeenClient.zip>`_.
	* Ruby folks: Gem install Keen. Reference :doc:`our Ruby Client Usage Guide <clients/ruby/usage_guide>`.
