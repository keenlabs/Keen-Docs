Keen provides public REST APIs to perform both :doc:`data collection<data_collection>` and :doc:`data analysis<data_analysis>`.

We created this documentation to explain event data, streamline your integration process, and describe our analysis features. Weâ€™d love to get your advice on what could make this documentation simpler or more powerful. Please email any feedback to `team@keen.io <mailto:team@keen.io>`_.
