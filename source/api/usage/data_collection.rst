====================
Data Collection APIs
====================

We built a massively scalable event data warehouse so that you can send us whatever data you want without having to worry about storage or performance.

Our public REST API lets you send data to Keen using standard HTTP POST methods, from any device. Our SDKs make integration even faster.

Unlike traditional databases like SQL, our database has no schema. You no longer need to think of data as a row with a limited number of columns. Our database holds JSON documents - theyâ€™re hierarchical and can have as many fields and values as you want. 

Checkout :doc:`events_and_event_data` to learn more about data you can post to our Data Collection API.
