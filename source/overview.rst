Keen provides public REST APIs to perform both :doc:`data collection<data_collection>` and data analysis.  

In addition to our APIs, we offer full export so you can pump data into your existing analysis workflow and flex your muscles in Excel, Tableau, or Hadoop.

We created this documentation to explain event data, streamline your integration process, and describe our analysis features. Weâ€™d love to get your advice on what could make this documentation simpler or more powerful. Please email any feedback to team@keen.io.
