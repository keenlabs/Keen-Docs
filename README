Documentation for Keen.

Here's how to modify Keen docs (install Sphinx first)

1. Use Sphinx and TextMate to modify .rst files. Synch Keen-Docs and Keen-Web to your machine using github.
2. Open Keen-Docs in TextMate or another editor to make mods to the Spinx rst files. Don't modify html files directly.
3. Use Sphinx build HTML docs locally. Type "make html" in your Terminal.

for example:
	
	[michelle] ~/Dev/Keen-Docs $ make html

or use "make clean" to delete unused files (and other helpful things? sometimes this makes things work better)

	[michelle] ~/Dev/Keen-Docs $ make clean html
  
4. Check your build folder (/Keen-Docs/build/html) and open index.html to preview the build on your local machine.
5. Review warnings from the build process --- Sphinx is good at identifying broken links and new docs which are missing from the table of contents.


To deploy build docs:

1. You must set an environment variable on your local machine so that Sphinx can deposit html files into Keen-Web. You must have Keen-Web synched to your machine. This is a one-time step to set the environment variable:

In terminal:

	export KEEN_WEB_DIR=<Keen web directory on your machine>
	
	for example:
	export KEEN_WEB_DIR=/Users/michellewetzler/Dev/Keen-Web
	
Note: See Keen-Docs/build.sh for the configuration of this deployment folder.

2. I'm not sure if this required, but run the make html command prior to the build.

	for example:
	[michelle] ~/Dev/Keen-Docs $ make html

3. Now run the Sphinx build command to generate the html files in the Keen-Web folder.

	[michelle] ~/Dev/Keen-Docs $ ./build.sh
	
4. If you have the Keen-Web environment on your local machine, you can checkout the deployment locally.

5. Don't forget to commit your updated Sphinx docs (rst files) to the Keen-Docs repository on github. Make sure you're in the right branch (master)

6. Now you can push the final web code (html) to Keen-Web on github.

7. To deploy the new Keen-web code to staging, type this in HipChat:

	@robot keen deploy web to staging
	
8. Go to staging.keen.io to checkout the changes

9. If successful, deploy web to prod by typing this in HipChat:

	@robot keen deploy web to prod
